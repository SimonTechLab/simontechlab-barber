      <h3>A Dream Born from Friendship</h3>
      <p>
        At AMIRO Barbershop, it all starts with friendship. Over 20 years ago, two kids, Andrea Amighetti and Luca Rossi, sat next to each other in a classroom, unknowingly sharing a dream. What began as a simple bond grew into something more — a lifelong passion for the art of barbering. After years of living in different countries and following our separate paths, we reunited to bring that dream to life in the heart of Zürich. AMIRO Barbershop was born from more than just skill, it’s a product of two friends coming together to create something meaningful.
